🛒 Customer Segmentation & Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for retail transaction data. Customers are segmented into Low, Medium, and High spenders based on their total spend, and various insights are derived using visualizations and ML models.

The goal is to:

Understand customer purchase behavior

Segment customers by spending patterns

Perform EDA on Age, Product Category, and Payment Modes

🚀 Features Implemented

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Visualizations of spending trends
✔️ Age × Product Category analysis 👩‍🦱👨‍🦳
✔️ Payment Mode vs Average Spend 💳💵


⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization 📈

Scikit-learn for ML models

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for execution
