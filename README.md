🛒 Customer Segmentation & Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for retail transaction data. Customers are segmented into Low, Medium, and High spenders based on their total spend, and various insights are derived using visualizations and ML models.

The goal is to:

Understand customer purchase behavior

Segment customers by spending patterns

Perform EDA on Age, Product Category, and Payment Modes

Apply classification models and evaluate them with metrics like ROC Curve & Classification Report

1️⃣ Customer Segments

2️⃣ Age vs Product Category

3️⃣ Payment Mode vs Average Spend

4️⃣ ROC Curve for Classification

🚀 Features Implemented

✔️ Customer Segmentation: Low / Medium / High Spenders
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
